# Toy Robot Simulator

This application simulates a toy robot moving on a 5x5 square tabletop.

## Description

-   This application simulates a toy robot moving on a 5x5 square tabletop.
-   The tabletop has no obstructions.
-   The robot can move freely on the tabletop but must not fall off.
-   Clicking on a table space will PLACE the robot on the table at the clicked position
    (using X, Y coordinates), facing north.
-   The origin (0,0) is at the SOUTH WEST corner of the table (bottom left).
-   The first valid command is a PLACE command. Subsequent commands can be
    issued in any order, including another PLACE command (i.e. you can click another
    space and it would place the original toy robot on that space).
-   MOVE will move the toy robot one space forward in the direction it is currently
    facing.
-   LEFT and RIGHT will rotate the robot 90 degrees in the specified direction without
    changing the position of the robot.
-   REPORT will announce the X,Y position and F (facing direction) of the robot.
-   A robot not on the table ignores commands.
-   Commands can be issued via buttons on the page or arrow keys
-   Provide test instructions to exercise the application.

## Constraints

-   The toy robot must not fall off the table during movement. This also includes the
    initial placement of the toy robot. (i.e. clicking off the table should do nothing)
-   Any move that would cause the robot to fall must be ignored.

## Example Input and Output

```bash
a)
PLACE 0,0,NORTH
MOVE
REPORT
Output: 0,1,NORTH
b)
PLACE 0,0,NORTH
LEFT
REPORT
Output: 0,0,WEST
c)
PLACE 1,2,North
MOVE
MOVE
RIGHT
MOVE
REPORT
Output: 2,4,East
```

## Deliverables

-   This can be built in any frontend framework or library that you’re comfortable
    with. (i.e. angular, react, vue, ember, etc.)
-   The source files, the test data and any test code in a git repo.
-   [BONUS] Add some styles, or optionally use both buttons and arrow keys
-   Timebox: Try not to spend more than 4 hours on this exercise.
